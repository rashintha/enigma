## Version Controlling
It's very important to do version controlling when using javascript files otherwise the client browser will use cached items. Enigma uses the version in `configurations.php` around the whole system so when ever you are releasing a new version, remember to change the version in the configurations file.

## Common js Functions
You can use `app/assets/js/functions.js` for all of your common javascript functions and they will be available through the whole system.
